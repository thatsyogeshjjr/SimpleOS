# SimpleOS
_A simple x86 operating system built from scratch to study OS development._

## **Overview**
SimpleOS is a minimal operating system designed to provide a hands-on understanding of how operating systems work at the lowest level. It includes a basic bootloader and a kernel written in assembly and C. The goal is to understand system bootstrapping, memory management, and basic OS functionality.

## **Features (Planned/Implemented)**
- [x] Bootloader using NASM
- [x] 32-bit Protected Mode transition
- [ ] Basic kernel with printing to screen
- [ ] Simple memory management (paging)
- [ ] Keyboard input handling
- [ ] User-mode and syscalls

## **Tools Used**
- **QEMU** (for virtualization and testing)
- **NASM** (for writing the bootloader and low-level assembly)
- **GCC / LD** (for compiling the kernel, if applicable)
- **Make** (for automated builds)

## **Architecture**
- **Target:** x86 (IA-32)
- **Bootloader:** Custom NASM bootloader
- **Kernel Language:** Assembly (with planned C integration)
- **File System:** None (yet)

## **Building & Running**
### **1. Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **QEMU**
- **NASM**
- **(Optional) GCC & Make**

### **Building**
